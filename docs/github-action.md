# GitHub Action

Themis can run as a composite GitHub Action. The action installs Nix by default, runs the flake-packaged CLI, writes the gate output to the GitHub Step Summary, and uploads the report artifact.

## Marketplace

GitHub may show a repository banner offering to publish Themis to the GitHub Marketplace because this repository contains a root `action.yml` file. Marketplace publication is optional; workflows can already use the action directly with `Pheoxy/themis@v1.0.3`.

The Marketplace display name is `Themis PR Gate` because Marketplace action names are globally unique and cannot match an existing action, user, or organization name.

Publish to Marketplace from a normal future release after reviewing the release notes and action metadata. Do not move an existing public release tag only to change Marketplace metadata.

## Pull Request Gate

```yaml
name: Themis

on: pull_request

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: read

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Write PR body
        env:
          PR_BODY: ${{ github.event.pull_request.body }}
        run: printf '%s' "$PR_BODY" > pr-body.md
      - uses: Pheoxy/themis@v1.0.3
        with:
          base: origin/${{ github.base_ref }}
          body-file: pr-body.md
          run-checks: "true"
```

More complete copyable examples live in `examples/github-actions/`:

- `validate.yml`: default hard gate with read-only pull request permissions.
- `comment.yml`: maintainer-facing comment workflow with `format: comment` and `comment-pr: "true"`.
- `self-check.yml`: combined doctor/rules/providers/gate workflow.
- `config-check.yml`: lightweight `.themis.toml` validation workflow.

## Inputs

- `repo`: repository path to validate. Default: `.`.
- `base`: base ref for the diff. Optional for `config-check`; recommended for PR gate workflows.
- `body-file`: file containing the pull request body. Required when `draft-pr` is `true`.
- `evidence`: inline test/check evidence.
- `evidence-file`: file containing test/check evidence.
- `human-authored`: set to `true` only when no AI assistance was used.
- `run-checks`: run `.themis.toml` required checks. Default: `true`.
- `workflow`: Themis workflow to run. Use `validate`, `guide`, `maintainer-packet`, `self-check`, or `config-check`. Default: `validate`.
- `output`: report path. Default: `upstream-validation-report.md`.
- `format`: Themis output format. Use `markdown`, `comment`, `json`, or `sarif`. `self-check` and `config-check` support only `markdown` and `json`. Default: `markdown`.
- `annotations`: CI annotation mode. Use `github` or `none`. Default: `github`.
- `step-summary`: write gate output to the GitHub Step Summary when possible. Default: `true`.
- `comment-pr`: post the generated gate output as a pull request comment using `gh`. Default: `false`.
- `pr-number`: pull request number for `comment-pr`. Defaults to `github.event.pull_request.number` when available.
- `draft-pr`: create a draft PR after validation passes. Default: `false`.
- `title`: draft PR title override. Used only when `draft-pr` is `true`.
- `base-branch`: draft PR target branch override. Used only when `draft-pr` is `true`.
- `head-branch`: draft PR source branch override. Used only when `draft-pr` is `true`.
- `install-nix`: install Nix before running. Default: `true`.

## Outputs

- `status`: `pass` when Themis exits `0`, otherwise `blocked`.
- `exit-code`: Themis CLI exit code.
- `report`: path to the generated Themis output artifact.

Draft PR creation from CI requires write permissions and GitHub CLI authentication. Keep it opt-in.
When `draft-pr` is `true`, the action runs `themis pull-request draft` regardless of `workflow`.
Draft PR mode requires `body-file` so Themis can build the PR body from the submitter's text plus the validation report.

Markdown reports are appended directly to the summary. Comment, JSON, and SARIF reports are wrapped in fenced code blocks so the check summary remains readable.

PR commenting requires `pull-requests: write` and a valid `GH_TOKEN`. Comment failures emit a warning instead of replacing the gate result. Use `format: comment` for concise comment bodies.

The `self-check` and `config-check` workflows reject output formats other than `markdown` and `json`.

The `config-check` workflow ignores gate-only inputs such as `base`, `body-file`, `evidence`, and `annotations`.

The examples in `examples/github-actions/` show the expected permission split:

- validation and self-check use `pull-requests: read`.
- config-check uses `contents: read` only.
- PR comments use `pull-requests: write` and `GH_TOKEN`.

## Maintainer Packet Workflow

Use the maintainer packet workflow when the action should produce contributor-facing feedback instead of the default validation report:

```yaml
- uses: Pheoxy/themis@v1.0.3
  with:
    base: origin/${{ github.base_ref }}
    body-file: pr-body.md
    workflow: maintainer-packet
    run-checks: "true"
```

## PR Comment Workflow

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

steps:
  - uses: Pheoxy/themis@v1.0.3
    env:
      GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
    with:
      base: origin/${{ github.base_ref }}
      body-file: pr-body.md
      format: comment
      comment-pr: "true"
```
