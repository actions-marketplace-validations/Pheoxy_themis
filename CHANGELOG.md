# Changelog

All notable changes to Themis will be documented in this file.

The format follows Keep a Changelog conventions, and this project follows Semantic Versioning starting with `1.0.0`.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.3] - 2026-09-10

Patch release so Marketplace and documented `Pheoxy/themis@v1.0.3` pins include the DCO merge-commit skip and the Nix installer v23 bump.

### Fixed

- DCO and Conventional Commits checks now skip git merge commits, so GitHub "Update branch" merge commits without `Signed-off-by` no longer fail an otherwise signed PR.

### Changed

- GitHub Action Nix installer updated from `DeterminateSystems/nix-installer-action@v22` to `v23` in `action.yml` and the release workflow.
- Documented GitHub Action examples and the README release badge now pin `Pheoxy/themis@v1.0.3`.
- `SECURITY.md` now points reporters at GitHub private vulnerability reporting, which is enabled on this repository.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-07-01

Patch release for GitHub Marketplace publication metadata.

### Changed

- GitHub Action Marketplace display name changed from `Themis` to `Themis PR Gate` so it satisfies Marketplace's global action-name uniqueness requirement.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-01

Patch release focused on public repository operations, bot dependency maintenance, GitHub Action metadata, and protected PR workflow hardening after the initial `1.0.0` release.

### Added

- Repo-specific issue and pull request templates for Themis policy, release, and validation workflows.
- Issue forms for structured bug reports, feature requests, and policy false positives.
- GitHub Sponsors metadata for the public repository sponsor button.
- CODEOWNERS metadata for repository ownership and future review rules.
- Renovate version-update configuration for Nix flake inputs and GitHub Actions.
- Explicit Renovate Nix manager opt-in and weekly lock-file maintenance for `flake.lock`.
- Pull request validation now checks the PR head commit instead of GitHub's synthetic merge commit, avoiding false DCO failures for signed-off bot commits.
- Renovate PR bodies include a checked automation acknowledgement compatible with Themis' PR-template gate.
- GitHub Action branding metadata and Marketplace publication guidance.
