# Security Policy

Themis is a validation gate, so security issues include ordinary vulnerabilities and validation bypasses that could let risky code pass as safe. Themis does not certify that passing code is secure; it only reports configured blockers and evidence gaps.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes target the latest `1.x` release and the default branch. Older releases may receive fixes at maintainer discretion until a formal long-term support policy exists.

## Reporting A Vulnerability

Report security issues privately before publishing details.

For this GitHub-hosted repository, use [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/Pheoxy/themis/security/advisories/new). That form stays private. Do not include exploit details in a public issue.

If you are reporting against a different Themis deployment with no private channel, open a minimal public issue that states a private security report is needed, without exploit details.

Include:

- Affected version or commit.
- Reproduction steps.
- Expected and actual validator behavior.
- Whether the issue can cause a false pass, secret exposure, command execution, or incorrect pull request creation.

## Security Expectations

- Themis must fail closed when it cannot inspect a repository safely.
- Themis must not silently ignore failed required checks.
- Themis must not create pull requests when blockers exist.
- Themis must treat secrets in diffs as hard blockers.
